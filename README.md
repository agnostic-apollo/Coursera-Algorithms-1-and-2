# Coursera-Algorithms-1-and-2

Algorithm implementations in C++ for the Assignments of the Coursera Algorithms 1 and 2 Course by Tim Roughgarden (Standford) taken in Eary 2015.

A few algorithms require boost libraries to be added or recursive stack size to be increased. 
Instructions for doing that in CodeBlocks for Windows are given in "Codeblocks instructions.txt" in relevant folders.

Apologies for missing comments in a lot of the codes. I guess I wasn't into those at the time I implemented these.
